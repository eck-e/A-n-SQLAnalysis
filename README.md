# A SQL vs An SQL - A Personal Python Project
This project is a pilot study investigating the use of "a SQL" vs "an SQL" across various platforms. Two platforms (Medium.com, JSTOR) were used to gather data from this pilot. Further study would ideally expand the amount and type of data sources. 

## Background
The pronunciation of SQL varies across speakers, with some saying "sequel" and some pronouncing the individual letters "S, Q, L". This difference can be observed in writing through the use of "a" or "an" before "SQL". Because "a" is used before consonants, "a SQL" suggests that the writer pronounces "SQL" like the word "sequel". In contrast, "an SQL" suggests that the writer pronounces "SQL" like "S-Q-L" (the letter S in this case would sound like "es" and would therefore require the use of "an" before the "e" vowel sound).

Based on my analysis, the distribution of "an SQL" to "a SQL" (as percentages of total usage) changed over time. The percentage of "an SQL" decreased over time while the percentage of "a SQL" increased over time.
